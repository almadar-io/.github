Hi there 👋
Welcome to the Orbital Framework, a powerful, modular programming framework designed for the AI age. Our framework leverages the concept of "Orbital Units" to help you build robust backend and frontend applications with ease.

🙋‍♀️ Introduction
The Orbital Framework is a cutting-edge tool that allows developers to create full-stack applications using modular components called Orbital Units. These units can be invoked with a "Model name" parameter to generate complete Node.js backend and React frontend code. Our framework is designed to be flexible, powerful, and easy to use, making it perfect for building modern applications.

🌈 Contribution Guidelines

Key Features
Modular Design: Build applications by composing different modules that build on top of each other.
Orbital Units: Fundamental building blocks of the framework, each responsible for specific functionalities.
Full Stack Generation: Generate complete Node.js backend and React frontend code with a single command.
Domain Logic Integration: Define custom logic for forms, media, CRUD operations, and more.

Orbital Units
1. CRUD Service
The CRUD Service is responsible for creating, reading, updating, and deleting routes. It also handles form data storage and retrieval over HTTP and other interfaces.

2. Forms Service
The Forms Service manages the creation and handling of form data, ensuring smooth data flow and validation.

3. Media Service
The Media Service is used to store and retrieve files, providing a robust mechanism for managing media content within the application.
